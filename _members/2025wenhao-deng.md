I am a PhD student in the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow, advised by Prof. Joemon Jose. Prior to my PhD, I served as a Research Assistant at Westlake University, where I worked on agentic systems for scientific discovery and AI for physics simulations. Before that, as a visiting student at Westlake, I was among the earliest researchers exploring LLM-based recommendation systems. I earned an MSc from the University of Nottingham, graduating with distinction.

My current research interests are inï¼š
LLM-based recommender systems
Agentic systems for information retrieval 
Generative methods for recommendation and information completion
