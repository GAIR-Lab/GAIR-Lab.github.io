I am a first-year PhD student advised by Prof. [Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/) at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Before this, I was a Research Assistant at [Westlake University](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/), focusing on Modality-based Recommender Systems. My current research interests are in:

- Efficiency in multimodal recommendation and information retrieval systems
- Multimodal Generative Models
