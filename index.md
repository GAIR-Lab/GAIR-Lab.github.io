The home page of the Laboratory for Generative AI Solutions for Information Retrieval Applications (GAIR üçÄ) at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow. GAIR-Lab is led by  [Prof. Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/).

Our lab is now recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong AI backgrounds.

### Research Interests

The research interests of our lab broadly span many areas of computational biology and bioinformatics.  Some of our main areas of interest include:

  * Algorithms for high-throughput transcriptomics (RNA-seq)
    * assembly, quantification, *de novo* analysis, differential expression
    * gene expression analysis of single-cell sequencing data (specifically, single-cell RNA-seq)
  * Data structures for indexing genomes and raw genomic data
    * data structures for building, indexing and querying one or more reference genomes
    * data structures for indexing collections of tens of thousands of raw sequencing experiments
  * Applications of approximate and data-driven representations and data structures in bioinformatics
