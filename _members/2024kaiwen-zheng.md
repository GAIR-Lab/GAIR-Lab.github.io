I am a first-year PhD student advised by Prof. [Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/) at [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). Before this, I received my master's degree from [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) in 2024 and my master's project ("Facial Micro-expression Recognition") is supervised by Prof. [Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/) and [Xuri Ge](https://xurige1995.github.io/). My current research interests are in:
