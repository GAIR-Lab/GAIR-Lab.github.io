I am a Professor at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, Scotland and a member of the Information Retrieval group I am interested in all aspects of information retrieval (theory, experimentation, evaluation and applications) in the textual and multimedia domain. My research focuses around the following three themes: (i) Social Media Analytics; (ii) Multimodal interaction for information retrieval; (iii) Multimedia mining and search. I lead the Multimedia Information Retrieval group which investigates research issues related to the above themes.
