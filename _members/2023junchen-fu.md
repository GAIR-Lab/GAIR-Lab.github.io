I am a third-year PhD candidate at the University of Glasgow, advised by Prof. Joemon M. Jose, and have also been fortunate to be mentored by Dr. Alexandros Karatzoglou and Dr. Ioannis Arapakis. I am currently a visiting scholar at Leiden University, advised by Prof. Zhaochun Ren and Prof. Suzan Verberne. Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at Westlake University under the supervision of Prof. Fajie Yuan, focusing on modality-based recommender systems. I received my MSc in Computer Science from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I graduated with Deanâ€™s List honors.

My current research interests include:

Multimodal Recommendation/Information Retrieval
Efficient Finetuning for Multimodal Foundation Models
New Multimedia Applications using Generative Models (Including LLMs and Diffusion models)
I enjoy tackling non-trivial research questions with simple yet effective solutions. I am seeking to collaborate on a research project with self-motivated MSc students from UofG, particularly those interested in pursuing a PhD.
