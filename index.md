# GAIR-Lab at the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow

The home page of the Laboratory for Generative AI Solutions for Information Retrieval Applications ([GAIR](https://gair-lab.github.io/) üçÄ) at the School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow. GAIR-Lab is led by  [Prof. Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/).

Our lab is now recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong AI backgrounds.
<!-- 
Mangul Lab is part of the Titus Department of Clinical Pharmacy at [USC Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://pharmacyschool.usc.edu/) and [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at [USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences](https://dornsife.usc.edu/). Our research aims to design, develop and apply novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education. Our research is dedicated to all freedom-loving people around the world, to the people of Ukraine who fight for our freedom.-->
