# GAIR Lab

The homepage of the Laboratory for Generative AI Solutions for Information Retrieval Applications ([GAIR](https://gair-lab.github.io/) üçÄ) at the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). GAIR-Lab is led by  [Prof. Joemon Jose](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/joemonjose/).

GAIR Lab is committed to researching generative artificial intelligence solutions for multimedia tasks, including Information Retrieval(multi-modal recommendation, multi-modal retrieval, efficient multi-modal representation, etc.) and Social Media Analytics(multi-modal sentiment analysis, event detection from social streams, expression recognition, etc.), etc. 

Our lab is now recruiting self-motivated Ph.D. students with strong AI backgrounds.

We focus on exploring generative AI solutions to various information problems, including: 
<ul>
  <li>Recommendation, with a special emphasis on Multimodal Recommendation</li>
  <li>Multimodal LLMs</li>
  <li>Image sentence retrieval</li>
  <li>Facial Action Units recognition</li>
  <li>Facial Expression detection</li>
  <li>Conflict Detection on social media</li>
  <li>Legal Prediction & Judgement Generation</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, our approach is centred around leveraging Large Language Models to address such research problems.</p>
